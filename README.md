# vcs-connect

effx is a service intelligence platform that helps organizations tame their services.
vcs-connect ingests `effx.yaml` files from your version control systems using a regularly scheduled cronjob.
This is ideal for organizations who have many repositories or prefer indexing is done on the side.
